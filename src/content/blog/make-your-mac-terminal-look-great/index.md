## 1. Introduction

When I started programming the terminal on my iMac always looked pale in contrast to the fancy terminals the people on Youtube and other learning ressources had.


## 2. Download iTerm 2

On the project page of Iterm 2 you can find the download link. The terminal emulator is free of charge as it is open source.

Once you have downloaded the terminal emulator unzip it and drag the program into your programs folder.
