## 2. Choosing the OS
Recommended OS: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) is the best choice as itâ€™s optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. 
It has a large community, so finding support is easy. 

Alternatively, you can use Ubuntu Server (64-bit), which is more server-focused and provides a good balance between performance and flexibility.
